# ElitePC

ElitePC is a full-stack ecommerce application for browsing and ordering high-performance PCs, components, and peripherals. It combines a responsive React storefront, a Laravel REST API, inventory-aware order processing, an Admin workspace, PDF invoices, and a Gemini-powered catalog assistant.

The repository is organized as a single project with independently runnable frontend and backend applications. Docker Compose is the recommended way to start the complete stack.

## Features

### Storefront

- API-backed product catalog, categories, search, and product detail pages
- Responsive product cards with stock, pricing, specifications, and image fallbacks
- Guest cart with quantity controls and persistent browser storage
- Favorites scoped locally to each authenticated user, with separate guest favorites
- Checkout with delivery details, payment-method selection, and validation feedback
- Customer registration, login, logout, and persisted Sanctum bearer-token sessions
- Authenticated order history and customer-authorized order details
- Downloadable, print-friendly PDF invoices
- Dark and light themes with a shared ElitePC visual system
- Responsive layouts for desktop, tablet, and mobile

### Order and inventory safety

- Prices are recalculated from current database values on the server
- Product rows are locked during checkout to prevent concurrent overselling
- Stock availability is validated before an order is created
- Cancelling an order restores its stock once
- Reactivating a cancelled order revalidates and deducts stock
- Deleting an active order safely restores stock
- Customers can access only their own orders and invoices

### Administration

- Role-protected Admin interface
- Real dashboard KPIs for clients, products, orders, in-progress orders, and confirmed revenue
- Product and category management
- Order review and status management
- User creation, editing, and safe deletion rules
- Recent-order overview and inventory visibility

### Elite AI

- Gemini-backed PC hardware shopping assistant
- Product questions, comparisons, recommendations, and compatibility guidance
- Responses grounded in the live ElitePC catalog, including exact USD prices and stock
- Bounded conversation history and model fallback handling
- Backend-only Gemini credentials

Elite AI does not access private customer information, track orders, place orders, or complete purchases.

## Prerequisites

### Docker setup

- Git
- Docker Desktop, or Docker Engine with Docker Compose v2

### Manual setup

- PHP 8.2 or newer with the extensions required by Laravel and PDO MySQL
- Composer 2
- Node.js compatible with Vite 8; Node.js 22 LTS is recommended and used by Docker
- npm
- MySQL or MariaDB

## Quick start with Docker

Clone the repository into an `ElitePC` directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohamedAmine-py/ecommerce-fresh.git ElitePC
cd ElitePC
```

Copy the Docker environment template to the root `.env` file.

PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.docker.example .env
```

macOS/Linux:

```bash
cp .env.docker.example .env
```

The included values are local-development defaults. Add a valid `GEMINI_API_KEY` if Elite AI is needed, and replace the database credentials before using the configuration in any shared environment.

Build and start the stack:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Open:

- Storefront: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- Laravel API: [http://localhost:8000/api](http://localhost:8000/api)
- Backend health check: [http://localhost:8000/up](http://localhost:8000/up)

The MySQL service is available only inside the Compose network. Laravel waits for MySQL and runs incremental `php artisan migrate --force` migrations when the backend starts. It never runs `migrate:fresh`, and seeding does not run automatically.

MySQL data persists in the `mysql_data` volume. When no explicit `APP_KEY` is supplied, the generated local key persists in the `laravel_runtime` volume.

Common lifecycle commands:

```bash
# Stop containers and preserve volumes
docker compose down

# Restart existing containers
docker compose up -d

# Rebuild after Docker, dependency, or frontend build-setting changes
docker compose up --build -d
```

Avoid `docker compose down --volumes` when the Docker database must be preserved.

## Environment configuration

Environment files can contain credentials and must not be committed. The committed example files contain development placeholders only.

### Root `.env` — Docker Compose

Create this file from `.env.docker.example`.

- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: database created by the MySQL container
- `MYSQL_USER`: application database user
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: application database password
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: MySQL root password
- `APP_KEY`: optional explicit Laravel key; when empty, Docker generates and persists one locally
- `APP_ENV`: Laravel environment, default `local`
- `APP_DEBUG`: Laravel debug output, default `false` in Docker
- `BACKEND_URL`: public Laravel URL, default `http://localhost:8000`
- `BACKEND_PORT`: published backend port, default `8000`
- `FRONTEND_PORT`: published frontend port, default `3000`
- `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`: comma-separated permitted browser origins
- `VITE_API_URL`: browser-reachable API base URL, default `http://localhost:8000/api`
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`: private server-side Gemini key
- `GEMINI_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Gemini request timeout in seconds
- `LOG_LEVEL`: Laravel log level

Example placeholder:

```dotenv
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

Never prefix or duplicate this key as a Vite variable. Vite variables are embedded in the browser bundle.

### `backend/.env` — manual Laravel development

Create this file from `backend/.env.example`. Relevant settings include:

- Laravel application settings: `APP_NAME`, `APP_ENV`, `APP_KEY`, `APP_DEBUG`, `APP_URL`
- Database connection: `DB_CONNECTION`, `DB_HOST`, `DB_PORT`, `DB_DATABASE`, `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD`
- Browser access: `CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`
- Sessions, cache, queue, mail, filesystem, and logging settings provided by Laravel
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` for Elite AI
- `SEED_ADMIN_NAME`, `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `SEED_ADMIN_PASSWORD`
- `SEED_CLIENT_NAME`, `SEED_CLIENT_EMAIL`, `SEED_CLIENT_PASSWORD`

For MySQL local development, replace the example SQLite setting with your own local connection:

```dotenv
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=elitepc
DB_USERNAME=your_local_user
DB_PASSWORD=your_local_password
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:5173
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### `frontend/.env` — manual Vite development

Create this file from `frontend/.env.example`:

```dotenv
VITE_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8000/api
```

This URL is consumed by the browser and must point to a host reachable from the browser, not to an internal Docker service name.

## Manual local development

### Backend

From the repository root:

```bash
cd backend
composer install
```

Create the local environment file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On PowerShell, use `Copy-Item .env.example .env` instead. Configure the MySQL or MariaDB variables described above, create the named empty database, then run:

```bash
php artisan key:generate
php artisan migrate
php artisan serve
```

The API is available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/api` by default.

### Frontend

In a second terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

On PowerShell, use `Copy-Item .env.example .env`. The Vite development server is normally available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Database and seed data

The Docker stack uses MySQL 8.4. Manual development can use MySQL or MariaDB through Laravel's `mysql` driver.

Schema changes are managed by Laravel migrations:

```bash
cd backend
php artisan migrate
```

The optional seeder creates an idempotent development catalog and local demo accounts. Repeated runs do not duplicate its natural catalog identities, and existing product stock is not reset.

Run it only when demo data is wanted:

```bash
# Docker
docker compose exec backend php artisan db:seed

# Manual backend
php artisan db:seed
```

Do not use `migrate:fresh` on a database containing data that must be retained.

## Local demo accounts

`DatabaseSeeder` creates these accounts only when Laravel runs in the `local` or `testing` environment:

- Admin: `admin@ecommerce.test` / `admin123`
- Customer: `client@ecommerce.test` / `client123`

They are development-only defaults from `backend/.env.example`. Change the `SEED_*` values when needed, never use these credentials in production, and do not run local demo seeding in a production environment.

## API overview

All endpoints are prefixed with `/api`.

### Public

- `POST /register` — create a customer account
- `POST /login` — authenticate and issue a Sanctum bearer token
- `GET /products` — list products
- `GET /products/{id}` — retrieve a product
- `GET /categories` — list categories
- `POST /support/chat` — submit a bounded-history Elite AI message

### Authenticated

Send `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

- `GET /user` — current user
- `POST /logout` — revoke the current token
- `GET /orders` — current customer's orders; Admin receives all orders
- `POST /orders` — create an order
- `GET /orders/{id}` — authorized order details
- `GET /orders/{id}/invoice` — authorized PDF invoice download

### Admin only

These routes require both Sanctum authentication and the Admin role.

- `POST /products` — create a product
- `PUT /products/{id}` — update a product
- `DELETE /products/{id}` — safely delete a product
- `POST /categories` — create a category
- `PUT /categories/{id}` — update a category
- `DELETE /categories/{id}` — safely delete a category
- `PATCH /orders/{id}/status` — update order status
- `DELETE /orders/{id}` — safely delete an order
- `GET /admin/stats` — dashboard statistics and recent orders
- `GET|POST /admin/users` — list or create users
- `PUT|DELETE /admin/users/{id}` — update or safely delete a user

The exact request fields and validation rules remain defined by Laravel request classes and controllers.

## Testing and quality checks

Backend feature tests cover authentication and authorization, login rate limiting, order creation and inventory safety, invoice rendering, idempotent seeding, catalog currency grounding, AI history limits, and safe Admin deletion behavior.

```bash
cd backend
php artisan test
```

Format backend PHP with Laravel Pint:

```bash
cd backend
./vendor/bin/pint
```

On Windows PowerShell, `vendor/bin/pint` can be used when the shell resolves the PHP executable.

Frontend checks:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run lint
npm run build
```

The repository currently does not include a browser end-to-end test suite.

## Docker troubleshooting

Check container health and published ports:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

Inspect service logs:

```bash
docker compose logs backend
docker compose logs frontend
docker compose logs mysql
```

Check the backend directly:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/up
curl http://localhost:8000/api/products
```

If dependencies, Dockerfiles, Nginx configuration, `VITE_API_URL`, or another frontend build variable changes, rebuild the containers:

```bash
docker compose up --build -d
```

Nginx is configured to serve React Router URLs through `index.html`, including direct refreshes of `/products`, `/orders`, and nested product/order routes. If routing behavior appears stale, confirm the frontend image was rebuilt.

Changes to runtime backend variables normally require container recreation. Changes to `VITE_API_URL` require rebuilding the frontend because Vite embeds the value during compilation.

## Security notes

- Keep root, backend, and frontend `.env` files out of version control.
- Keep `GEMINI_API_KEY` server-side; never expose it through `VITE_*` variables.
- Public registration always creates a customer account and does not accept an Admin role.
- Admin endpoints are protected by Sanctum and role middleware.
- Login and Elite AI endpoints are rate-limited.
- Order totals use server-side database prices rather than client-submitted prices.
- Stock validation and mutation use transactions and row locks.
- Customer order and invoice access is ownership-checked by the backend.

These controls reduce common risks but do not replace environment-specific production hardening, HTTPS, secure secret management, monitoring, backups, and dependency maintenance.

## Project status

ElitePC is a finished full-stack portfolio application with a complete storefront, order workflow, Admin management, Docker Compose environment, and catalog-grounded AI assistant.

Current operational boundaries:

- Elite AI depends on Gemini API availability, credentials, and quota.
- No external payment gateway is integrated; checkout records the supported payment-method field only.
- Favorites persist per browser and account identity but are not synchronized through a backend favorites API.
- The Contact form is currently a non-submitting presentation placeholder.
- The repository does not include production hosting configuration or browser end-to-end tests.
